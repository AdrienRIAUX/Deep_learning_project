# Deep learning project

## Introduction

This repository contains my academic projects on deep learning issues, each projects has its own folder. The code and the results are avaliable through notebooks. You may find several notebooks on a project.

List of the project:
- Brain tumor classification

## ML techniques

You will find mainly supervised learning in the different projects. Advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning techniques are used to obtain results such as CNN, Transfer Learning, LSTM...
